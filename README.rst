Introduction and mission statement
----------------------------------
Aristotle-MDR is an open-source metadata registry as laid out by the requirements
of the `ISO/IEC 11179:2013 specification <http://metadata-standards.org/11179/>`_.

The Aristotle Metadata Registry represents a new way to manage and federate content built on and extending
the principles of leading metadata registries. The code of Aristotle is completely open-source,
building on the Django web framework and the mature model of the 11179 standard, allowing
agencies to easily run their own metadata registries while also having the ability
to extend the information model and tap into the permissions and roles of ISO 11179.

By allowing organisations to run their own independent registries they are able to
expose authoritative metadata along with the governance processes behind its creation,
and by building upon known and open systems agencies, can deliver a stable platform
for the sharing of metadata.

Extensions
++++++++++
The core of the Aristotle Metadata Registry is designed to conform to the models
described within ISO/IEC 11179-3,
However this mono-repo includes a number of standards-based extensions that
provide additional functionality or new metadata types.
