Fixes issues: #

Sanity checks:
- [ ] Have tests been run locally?
- [ ] Does this change any javascript? If so, have you checked that the UI works as expected?
- [ ] If there are data model changes, are relevant data standards referenced - in code?
- [ ] If there are deviations from any specified standards, are the reasons for changes documented?
- [ ] If there are UI changes have you documented whats changed so the help documentation can be updated?
