        <h2>Reversion formats</h2>
        <p>The Aristotle MDR provides an audit trial for modifications to metadata items. Changes are recorded and
          comparable to gain insight into how metadata has changed over time. There are two formats in which versions
          were saved <em>v1</em> and <em>v2</em>. Version 2 now captures a much greater range of fields for comparision.
          For example, changes to a Data Element inclusion in a Data Set Specification are now comparable.
